# CMPE108C

At a high level, I designed simple mechanism similar to Grand Central Dispatch,
that allows developers to quickly implement a number of different kinds of
multithreaded applications, or run a number of operations asynchronously very
easily and quickly.

For details on the project, please read the project report (CMPE 180C Project
Report.pdf).
